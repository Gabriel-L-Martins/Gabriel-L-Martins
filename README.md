### 🚀 Currently Diving Into

I am currently taking **Harvard's CS50x (Introduction to Computer Science)**, mastering fundamental concepts like algorithms, data structures, and the C programming language.

* **Languages I know (Basics):**
    * HTML5
    * CSS3
    * Python

* **My Toolkit:**
    * VS Code
    * Git / GitHub

### 🌱 My Next Steps

My immediate goal is to successfully complete the CS50x course and apply what I learn to build my first full-stack project. I'm particularly interested in **Web and Apps Development** and eventually exploring **Machine Learning**.
